## Components Overview

### EliminationAnswerList.cs
**Purpose**: Answer list with vote selection and cascade animation

**Features**:
- Displays all submitted answers (correct + robot + player answers)
- Desktop: Shows all answers including own
- Mobile: Filters out own answer
- Shuffle answers for randomness
- Cascade reveal animation (1s start + 200ms per item)
- Click/tap to select answer (turns red)
- Dynamic font sizing based on answer count:
  - 1 answer: 88px
  - 2 answers: 77px × 1.3 (30% larger)
  - 3 answers: 66px × 1.2 (20% larger)
  - 4-8 answers: 57px down to 35px
  - 9+ answers: 31px
- Highlight eliminated answer (red background, yellow text, scale 1.02)
- Disable voting after submission (grey out non-selected)
- Block own answer (desktop) and fallback answer

**Key Methods**:
- `SetupAnswers(answers, ownAnswer, filterOwn)` - Populate and animate
- `HighlightEliminatedAnswer(answer, duration)` - Red highlight
- `DisableVoting()` - Lock after vote submitted
- `ClearSelection()` / `ClearAnswers()` - Reset state

**Events**:
- `OnAnswerSelected(string answer)` - Fires when answer clicked

### EliminationResultPanel.cs
**Purpose**: Shows "ROBOT IDENTIFIED" or "TIE VOTE!" result

**Features**:
- Two result types:
  - **Normal**: Shows "ROBOT IDENTIFIED" headline with eliminated answer
  - **Tie**: Shows "TIE VOTE!" (uses robotidentno-slideout.png image)
- Slide-up animation (50ms delay, 800ms duration)
- Text reveal after slide (500ms delay)
- Holds for 5 seconds before callback
- Formatted with quotes around eliminated answer
- Footer text: "[YOU WILL NOW CHOOSE FROM THE REMAINING RESPONSES]"

**Key Methods**:
- `ShowNormalResult(answer, onComplete)` - Show elimination
- `ShowTieResult(onComplete)` - Show tie
- `Hide()` - Fade out panel

**Animation Sequence**:
```
0ms     → Delay 50ms
50ms    → Slide up from bottom + fade in (800ms)
850ms   → Delay 500ms
1350ms  → Text reveal
→ Hold 5000ms
→ onComplete callback
```

### EliminationScreenController.cs
**Purpose**: Main controller orchestrating voting flow

**Features**:
- Platform detection (desktop vs mobile)
- Answer list setup with shuffle
- Timer management (30 seconds)
- Vote submission and tracking
- Vote result simulation (real game would use server)
- Elimination calculation via VoteResults
- Result display sequence:
  1. Highlight eliminated answer (4s desktop, 2s mobile)
  2. Fade out answer list (500ms)
  3. Show result panel (slide-up animation)
  4. Play voice-over (robotanswergone or norobotanswergone)
  5. Hold 5s
  6. Transition to next screen
- Desktop: Auto-submits on selection (500ms delay)
- Mobile: Requires eliminate button tap

**Desktop Flow**:
```
Load → Fade in
    → Answer list cascades in
    → Timer scales in (1s delay)
    → User clicks answer
    → Auto-submit after 500ms
    → Highlight eliminated (4s)
    → Fade out list
    → Result panel slides up
    → Hold 5s
    → Fade to next scene
```

**Mobile Flow**:
```
Load → Fade in
    → Answer list cascades in (own answer filtered)
    → Timer starts
    → User taps answer (button enables)
    → User taps "ELIMINATE THIS ANSWER"
    → Highlight eliminated (2s)
    → Fade out list
    → Show tie/result text
    → Voice-over plays
    → Hold 3s
    → Fade to next scene
```

**Voting Logic**:
- Uses `VoteResults` from Phase 0
- Tracks votes per answer
- Calculates elimination (most votes)
- Handles ties (no elimination)
- Stores result in GameManager for scoring

**Key Methods**:
- `SubmitVote()` - Process player vote
- `AutoSubmitVote()` - Submit on timer expiration
- `SimulateVotingResults()` - Calculate elimination (mock server)
- `ShowResults()` - Display tie or elimination result
- `ShowEliminationResult(answer, duration)` - Highlight + panel
- `ShowTieResult()` - Tie panel or text
- `TransitionToNextScreen()` - Fade to VotingScreen

## Technical Implementation

### Vote Submission Flow

```
1. Player selects answer
   → selectedAnswer = answerText
   → Desktop: Auto-submit after 500ms
   → Mobile: Enable eliminate button

2. Submit vote
   → hasVoted = true
   → votingResults.AddVote(selectedAnswer)
   → Pause timer
   → Disable answer list
   → Wait 1s

3. Calculate results
   → votingResults.CalculateElimination()
   → Determines eliminatedAnswer or tieOccurred
   → (Real game: Wait for all players, server calculates)

4. Show results
   → If tie: ShowTieResult()
   → Else: ShowEliminationResult()
```

### Elimination Calculation

Uses `VoteResults` from Phase 0:

```csharp
votingResults.AddVote(answerText);
// ... all players vote ...
votingResults.CalculateElimination();

if (votingResults.TieOccurred) {
    // No answer eliminated
    // Show "TIE VOTE!"
} else {
    // votingResults.EliminatedAnswer = most voted
    // Show "ROBOT IDENTIFIED"
}
```

### Timer Integration

- 30 seconds countdown
- Same TimerDisplay component from QuestionScreen
- Auto-submits selected answer when timer expires
- If no selection: Player doesn't vote (no penalty)

### Answer Filtering

**Desktop**:
- Shows all answers (correct + robot + all players)
- Blocks own answer (not clickable)
- Blocks fallback "No answer provided"

**Mobile**:
- Filters out own answer (not shown)
- Blocks fallback "No answer provided"

## Known Limitations

1. **Voting Simulation**: Uses local vote calculation. Real game needs server to aggregate all player votes.

2. **Result Delay**: Currently shows results immediately after local vote. Real game waits for all players.

3. **Network Sync**: Desktop host should control timing, mobile follows. Current implementation is single-player.

4. **Next Scene**: Logs transition instead of loading VotingScreen (uncomment when scene exists).

## Files Summary

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| EliminationAnswerList.cs | Answer list with selection | ~350 |
| EliminationResultPanel.cs | Result overlay panel | ~140 |
| EliminationScreenController.cs | Main scene controller | ~380 |
| **Total** | | **~870 lines** |

## Next Phase Preview

**Phase 4: VotingScreen** - Vote for the correct answer:
- Very similar to EliminationScreen structure
- Desktop/Mobile answer lists
- Vote for correct answer (not to eliminate)
- Correct answer reveal after voting
- Vote count display on answers
- Success sound on mobile if voted correctly
- Points preview

Should be quick since it reuses EliminationScreen patterns.
