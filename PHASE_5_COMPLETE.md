### ResultsScreenController.cs
**Purpose**: Orchestrates 4-panel sequence and transitions

**Features**:
- Sequential panel display
- 5-second hold per panel (configurable)
- Round-specific banner (round1results.png - round12results.png)
- Banner rotated -8 degrees
- Next Round button slides in from right after all panels
- Button slideout background (buttonslideout.png)
- Checks if last round → Goes to FinalResults instead
- Platform detection (desktop/mobile)

**Panel Sequence**:
```
Load → Fade in (500ms)
    → Panel 1: Correct Answer (5s hold)
    → Fade out Panel 1
    → Panel 2: Robot Decoy (5s hold)
    → Fade out Panel 2
    → Panel 3: Player Answers (5s hold)
    → Fade out Panel 3
    → Panel 4: Standings (5s hold + stays visible)
    → Next Round button slides in (800ms)
    → User clicks → Fade to next scene

Total: ~20+ seconds before button appears
```

**Desktop Flow**:
1. Show round banner (rotated -8°)
2. Panel 1 → Panel 2 → Panel 3 → Panel 4
3. Button slideout appears from right
4. "Next Round" button clickable
5. Click → Fade to QuestionScreen or FinalResults

**Mobile Flow** (simplified):
- Auto-advances after desktop host
- Simplified single-screen or quick summary

**Key Methods**:
- `StartPanelSequence()` - Begin 4-panel flow
- `ShowNextPanel()` - Advance to next panel
- `ShowCorrectAnswerPanel()` - Panel 1 setup
- `ShowRobotDecoyPanel()` - Panel 2 setup
- `ShowPlayerAnswersPanel()` - Panel 3 setup
- `ShowStandingsPanel()` - Panel 4 setup
- `ShowNextRoundButton()` - Button slide-in
- `OnNextRoundClicked()` - Transition to next scene

## Technical Implementation

### Panel System Architecture

```
ResultsScreenController
├── CorrectAnswerPanel (Panel 1)
├── RobotDecoyPanel (Panel 2)
├── PlayerAnswersPanel (Panel 3)
└── StandingsPanel (Panel 4)

Each Panel extends ResultPanelBase:
- Show() → Fade in + Internal animations + Hold + onComplete
- Hide() → Fade out + onComplete
```

### Panel Transition Flow

```csharp
ShowPanel1() {
    panel1.Show(() => {
        panel1.Hide(() => {
            ShowPanel2();
        });
    });
}
```

### Cascade Animation Pattern

Used in all panels for icon/row reveals:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < items.Count; i++) {
    float delay = baseDelay + (i * cascadeDelay);
    DOVirtual.DelayedCall(delay, () => {
        AnimateItemIn(items[i]);
    });
}
```

### Scoring Display

Gets points from GameConstants based on game mode:
- 8-round: +8 correct, +4 robot ID, +4 per vote, -8 fooled
- 12-round: +6 correct, +3 robot ID, +3 per vote, -6 fooled

---

## Integration with Previous Phases

### From Phase 0:
- **GameConstants**: Scoring, fallback text, colors
- **AnswerValidator**: Check correct answers
- **GameManager**: Question, answers, players, rankings
- **RoundScore**: Detailed scoring breakdown (not fully used yet)

### From Phase 1:
- **FadeTransition**: Scene entry/exit
- **ResponsiveUI**: Platform detection
- **ButtonEffects**: Next Round button hover/press

### From Phases 2-4:
- **Player icons**: Reused from previous screens

## Known Limitations

1. **Vote Data**: Currently uses mock vote counts. Real game needs actual voting results from VotingScreen.

2. **Fooled Tracking**: Robot Decoy panel doesn't track actual fooled players. Needs elimination vote data.

3. **Round Scoring**: Uses simplified scoring. Full implementation needs RoundScore integration for detailed breakdown.

4. **Mobile UI**: Simplified/not implemented. Desktop flow only.

5. **Next Scene**: Logs transition instead of loading (uncomment when scenes exist).

## Files Summary

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| ResultPanelBase.cs | Base panel class | ~90 |
| CorrectAnswerPanel.cs | Panel 1 | ~200 |
| RobotDecoyPanel.cs | Panel 2 | ~250 |
| PlayerAnswersPanel.cs | Panel 3 | ~180 |
| StandingsPanel.cs | Panel 4 | ~210 |
| ResultsScreenController.cs | Main controller | ~330 |
| **Total** | | **~1,260 lines** |

## Next Phase Preview

**Phase 6: FinalResults** - Game over screen:
- Winner spotlight (left side)
- Last place spotlight (right side)
- Desktop: New Game / Credits buttons
- Mobile: Player placement, score, Share/Games buttons
- Confetti or celebration effects
- Single player: Shows winner only

Should be simpler than ResultsScreen since it's just one screen with two spotlights.

   - 4 Panel GameObjects (CorrectAnswerPanel, RobotDecoyPanel, etc.)
   - Button slideout container
   - Next Round button
4. Create MobileContent:
   - Background image (resultsmobile.png)
   - Simplified UI
5. Add controller GameObject with ResultsScreenController
6. Assign all panel references
7. Import round banner sprites (12 files)
8. Test panel sequence
9. Verify animations and timing
10. Test Next Round button
11. Add to Build Settings

**Next Action**: Create ResultsScreen scene in Unity Editor, or proceed to Phase 6 (FinalResults).
