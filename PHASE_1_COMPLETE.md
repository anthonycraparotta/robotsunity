## Components Overview

### LandingPageController.cs

**Purpose**: Controls the landing page behavior for both desktop and mobile platforms.

**Key Features**:
- Platform detection (desktop vs mobile)
- Desktop: Video player with rules, start button, fade effects
- Mobile: Black screen only (no video to avoid confusion)
- Keyboard support (Enter/Space keys on desktop)
- Fade in on scene load (100ms delay, 1s duration)
- Fade out on button click (1s delay, 1s duration)
- Audio integration (button press SFX, rules voice-over)
- Scene transition to next screen (JoinRoom/Lobby)

**Desktop Flow**:
1. Scene loads → Black overlay (alpha 1)
2. Video starts playing + rules VO starts
3. After 100ms → Fade to clear (1s duration)
4. User clicks Start button (or Enter/Space)
5. Button press sound plays
6. Voice-over stops
7. Wait 1 second
8. Fade to black (1s duration)
9. Transition to next scene

**Mobile Flow**:
1. Scene loads → Black screen displays
2. User taps Start button
3. Button press sound plays
4. Immediate transition to next scene (no fade)

**References Required**:
- Desktop Content GameObject
- Video Player component
- Start Button component
- Initial Fade Overlay CanvasGroup
- Mobile Content GameObject

## Scene Structure

### Hierarchy
```
Canvas (ResponsiveUI + CanvasScaler)
├── DesktopContent
│   ├── Background (Image: landingbg.png)
│   ├── VideoPlayerContainer
│   │   └── VideoPlayer (Video Player + RawImage)
│   ├── StartButton (Button + Image: startgamebutton.png + ButtonEffects)
│   └── InitialFadeOverlay (Image + CanvasGroup)
└── MobileContent
    └── BlackBackground (Image: black)

LandingPageController (empty GameObject)
└── LandingPageController component
```

### Asset Requirements
- **Images**: landingbg.png, startgamebutton.png
- **Video**: rulesvideo.mp4
- **Audio**: button_press SFX, landingrules VO
- **Fonts**: SINK.otf

## Technical Implementation Details

### Platform Detection
- Uses ResponsiveUI component to detect desktop (>768px) vs mobile (≤768px)
- Activates/deactivates appropriate content GameObjects
- Desktop shows full UI, mobile shows black screen only

### Video Player Setup
- Render Mode: Render Texture (recommended for UI)
- Creates Render Texture asset for video output
- Assigns to Raw Image for display
- Loop enabled, plays on awake
- Audio output via Direct mode

### Fade System
- Initial fade uses local CanvasGroup on overlay
- Exit fade uses global FadeTransition singleton
- Both use DOTween for smooth animations
- Ease: InOutQuad for professional feel

### Button Integration
- ButtonEffects component handles hover/press animations
- Hover: Scale 1.05x (desktop only)
- Press: Scale 0.95x
- Automatically plays button_press SFX
- Controller adds click listener for logic

### Keyboard Support
- Update() checks for Enter and Space keys
- Only active on desktop
- Only active when not already transitioning
- Triggers same behavior as button click

### Audio Integration
- Voice-over plays on desktop scene load (via AudioManager)
- Button press sound via ButtonEffects component
- Voice-over stops on button click (prevents overlap)

## Setup Instructions

Complete step-by-step setup guide provided in:
**`LandingPage_SceneSetup.md`**

Includes:
- Detailed hierarchy creation steps
- Inspector settings for all components
- Asset import requirements
- Video player render texture setup
- Testing checklist (desktop and mobile)
- Common issues and solutions

---

## Integration with Phase 0

Uses the following Phase 0 components:

### From Core:
- `GameConstants` - UI constants, delays, audio clip names

### From Managers:
- `AudioManager` - SFX and voice-over playback
- `GameManager` - (not used in this scene, but available)

### From UI Utilities:
- `ButtonEffects` - Standard button hover/press effects
- `FadeTransition` - Fade to black overlay (exit transition)
- `ResponsiveUI` - Desktop/mobile detection and layout switching

## Testing Checklist

### Desktop Mode (1920x1080)
- [ ] Scene loads with black overlay
- [ ] Video plays automatically
- [ ] Rules voice-over plays
- [ ] Fade to clear after 100ms (1s duration)
- [ ] Start button visible at bottom center
- [ ] Button image displays correctly
- [ ] Hover scales button to 1.05x
- [ ] Click plays button_press sound
- [ ] Click stops voice-over
- [ ] 1-second delay before fade
- [ ] Fade to black (1s duration)
- [ ] Scene transition occurs
- [ ] Enter key works same as click
- [ ] Space key works same as click

### Mobile Mode (375x812)
- [ ] Black screen displays
- [ ] No video shows
- [ ] No start button visible
- [ ] MobileContent active, DesktopContent inactive
- [ ] (Button still functional if needed for testing)

### General
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] ResponsiveUI detects platform correctly
- [ ] DOTween animations smooth
- [ ] Audio plays without issues

## Known Limitations

1. **Next Scene Placeholder**: Currently logs transition message instead of loading next scene. Uncomment `SceneManager.LoadScene()` when JoinRoom scene exists.

2. **Mobile Button**: Mobile black screen doesn't show button by design, but button is still wired up. You may want to add a hidden button or tap-anywhere functionality.

3. **Video Audio**: Video Player audio handling may need adjustment based on browser/platform (especially for WebGL builds with autoplay policies).

4. **Render Texture**: Requires manual creation in Unity Editor. Could be created programmatically if needed.

## Next Phase Preview

**Phase 2: QuestionScreen** will be the largest and most complex scene:
- Desktop: Card flip animation, robot character, answer overlay
- Mobile: Input field, validation, submit button
- Timer with visual states (normal/warning/critical)
- Real-time answer validation
- Player icon grid
- Audio cues at specific timestamps

Phase 2 will be split into 5 subsections to avoid token limits.

## To Create Scene in Unity

1. Open Unity Editor
2. Create new Scene: File → New Scene
3. Save as "LandingPage"
4. Follow step-by-step guide in `LandingPage_SceneSetup.md`
5. Assign LandingPageController.cs to controller GameObject
6. Test in both desktop and mobile Game view sizes
7. Add to Build Settings when ready

---

**Next Action**: Create LandingPage scene in Unity Editor following the setup guide, or proceed to Phase 2 planning.
