## Components Overview

### PlayerSpotlightCard.cs
**Purpose**: Spotlight card component for highlighting winner or last place player

**Features**:
- Two spotlight types: Winner (green) and Last Place (red)
- Winner card: 1.04x scale, bright green border/text

- Subtitles: "MOST HUMAN" or "ROBOT IDENTIFIED"
- Player icon loading from Resources
- Placement rank display (e.g., "#1")

**Animation Sequence**:
```
Show() called with delay
    ↓
Delay expires
    ↓
0ms     → Start with Y offset -30px, alpha 0
    ↓
600ms   → Slide to original Y, fade to alpha 1
    ↓
600ms   → AnimateScore callback
    ↓
2100ms  → Score count-up complete (1.5s duration)
```

**Key Methods**:
- `ShowCard(player, rank, totalPlayers, spotlightType, delay)` - Setup and show card with delay

### FinalResultsController.cs
**Purpose**: Main controller for Final Results screen

**Features**:
- Platform detection (desktop vs mobile)
- Desktop layout:
  - Background image (finalresultsbg.png)
  - Hero image (fadein.png) - fades in at 0.5s
  - Winner spotlight card (left side) - appears at 1s
  - Last place spotlight card (right side) - appears at 1.1s
  - Action buttons slide in at 2.5s
  - Button slideout background (buttonslideout.png)
  - New Game button → resets game and returns to LandingPage
  - Credits button → placeholder for credits screen
- Mobile layout:
  - Simplified single-player view
  - Player icon, name, placement, total score
  - Share Results button
  - Games button
- Handles single-player mode (only shows winner)
- Scene fade transitions

**Desktop Animation Timeline**:
```
0ms     → Fade in scene (500ms)
500ms   → Scene visible
        → Hero image starts fade in (500ms duration)
1000ms  → Winner card animation starts
1100ms  → Last place card animation starts (100ms stagger)
2500ms  → Button slideout slides in from left (-700px → 50px, 800ms)
3300ms  → Action buttons appear
        → Buttons clickable
```

**Mobile Flow**:
- Immediate display of local player's placement
- Simplified UI with placement text (e.g., "1st place of 4 players")
- Total score display
- Share and Games buttons

**Desktop Flow**:
1. Fade in scene
2. Hero image fades in
3. Winner card slides up from bottom
4. Last place card slides up (100ms after winner)
5. Both cards count-up scores
6. Button slideout appears from left
7. New Game / Credits buttons become active
8. User clicks button → fade to next scene

**Key Methods**:
- `SetupPlatformContent()` - Show/hide desktop vs mobile content
- `SetupDesktop()` - Initialize desktop components
- `SetupMobile()` - Initialize mobile components
- `AnimateDesktop()` - Orchestrate desktop entrance sequence
- `ShowActionButtons()` - Slide in button panel
- `OnNewGameClicked()` - Reset game state and return to LandingPage
- `OnCreditsClicked()` - Show credits (placeholder)
- `OnShareResultsClicked()` - Mobile share functionality (placeholder)
- `OnGamesClicked()` - Return to game selection (placeholder)
- `GetPlacementSuffix(rank)` - Returns "st", "nd", "rd", "th"

**Integration Points**:
- GameManager.Instance.GetRankedPlayers() - Gets sorted player list
- GameManager.Instance.ResetGame() - Clears state for new game
- FadeTransition.Instance - Scene transitions
- ResponsiveUI - Platform detection
- ButtonEffects - Button hover/press effects

## Technical Implementation

### Spotlight Card System

```
PlayerSpotlightCard
├── Card Background (semi-transparent black)
├── Card Border (green or red)
├── Player Icon Wrapper
│   └── Player Icon Image (from Resources)
├── Badge Label ("WINNER" or "LAST PLACE")
├── Player Name Text (uppercase)
├── Subtitle Text ("MOST HUMAN" or "ROBOT IDENTIFIED")
├── Rank Label ("#1", "#4", etc.)
├── Score Label ("SCORE")
└── Score Value (animated count-up)
```

### Animation Pattern

**Slide + Fade**:
```csharp
Vector2 startPos = rectTransform.anchoredPosition;
startPos.y -= slideDistance; // -30px
rectTransform.anchoredPosition = startPos;

Sequence seq = DOTween.Sequence();
seq.Append(rectTransform.DOAnchorPosY(originalY, 0.6f).SetEase(Ease.OutQuad));
seq.Join(canvasGroup.DOFade(1f, 0.6f));
seq.AppendCallback(() => AnimateScore());
```

**Score Count-up**:
```csharp
DOVirtual.Float(0, player.Score, 1.5f, (value) => {
    scoreValue.text = Mathf.RoundToInt(value).ToString();
}).SetEase(Ease.OutQuad);
```

### Controller Flow

```csharp
Start()
    ↓
Get ranked players from GameManager
    ↓
Get local player (first player in list)
    ↓
Setup platform-specific UI
    ↓
FadeTransition.FadeIn(0.5f, StartAnimations)
    ↓
if (isDesktop)
    AnimateDesktop()
        ↓
        Hero fade → Winner card → Last place card → Buttons
else
    AnimateMobile()
        ↓
        Show player placement immediately
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Scene Loading**: Currently logs transitions instead of loading scenes (commented out for testing). Uncomment `SceneManager.LoadScene()` when all scenes exist.

2. **Credits Screen**: Button is placeholder - no credits screen implemented yet.

3. **Mobile Share**: Share Results button is placeholder - needs native sharing implementation.

4. **Games Navigation**: Games button is placeholder - needs lobby/game selection screen.

5. **Confetti/Celebration**: Original spec mentioned confetti for winner - not implemented (could be added as particle system).

6. **Multi-winner Ties**: Currently shows first player if tie for 1st place. Could show multiple spotlight cards for ties.
