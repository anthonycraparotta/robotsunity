## Key Components

### Core Systems

**GameConstants.cs**
- Centralized game constants (scoring, timing, thresholds)
- Game modes (8-round, 12-round)
- Time limits and visual thresholds
- Validation thresholds for answers
- Color system with hex conversion
- Audio clip name constants
- Enums for AnswerType and QuestionType

**AnswerValidator.cs**
- Answer similarity checking (Levenshtein distance)
- Duplicate detection (90% similarity)
- Correct answer validation (85% similarity)
- Profanity filtering (loads from data/banned_words.txt)
- Text normalization utilities

### Data Structures

**Question.cs**
- Question data model
- Support for text and picture questions
- Serializable for Unity inspector

**Answer.cs**
- Player answer submission model
- Type classification (Correct/Robot/Player)
- Serializable

**Player.cs**
- Player data with name, icon, score
- Score management methods
- Desktop/mobile flag support

**RoundScore.cs**
- Detailed round scoring breakdown
- Tracks all point sources (correct answer, robot ID, votes, fooled)
- Auto-calculates totals

**VoteResults.cs**
- Vote tracking and aggregation
- Elimination calculation (handles ties)
- Dictionary serialization for Unity

### Managers

**GameManager.cs (Singleton)**
- Central game state management
- Player management (add/remove/get)
- Round progression (start/next/check last)
- Answer collection and validation
- Score calculation
- Winner/rankings determination
- Game mode configuration

**AudioManager.cs (Singleton)**
- SFX and voice-over playback
- Separate audio sources for SFX, VO, music
- Desktop-only VO logic
- Volume control
- Audio clip dictionary for easy access
- Runtime audio loading support

### UI Utilities

**ButtonEffects.cs**
- Standard button hover/press effects (Component)
- DOTween animations (scale 1.05 hover, 0.95 press)
- Auto-plays button press sound
- Mobile-friendly (disables hover on touch)
- Interactable state management

**FadeTransition.cs (Singleton)**
- Fade in/out screen transitions
- Black overlay with configurable color
- Proper canvas layering (z-index 10000)
- Fade-out-action-fade-in pattern
- DOTween animations

**ResponsiveUI.cs (Component)**
- Desktop vs mobile detection (>768px = desktop)
- Canvas Scaler configuration
- Platform-specific content activation
- Safe area support for mobile
- Viewport unit conversion (vw/vh to pixels)

**TextScaler.cs (Component)**
- Dynamic text sizing to fit containers
- Auto-scales on text changes
- Character count-based scaling
- Answer count-based scaling (desktop/mobile)
- Overflow detection
- Text truncation with ellipsis

## Usage Notes

### Setting Up Managers in Unity

1. **GameManager**: Auto-creates as singleton on first access, persists across scenes
2. **AudioManager**: Auto-creates as singleton on first access
3. **FadeTransition**: Auto-creates as singleton on first access

Alternatively, create empty GameObjects in your first scene:
- "GameManager" with GameManager component
- "AudioManager" with AudioManager component
- "FadeTransition" with FadeTransition component

Mark them as DontDestroyOnLoad to persist.

### Audio Setup

AudioManager requires audio clips to be assigned:
- Either via Inspector (assign clips to serialized fields)
- Or via Resources folder at runtime using `LoadAudioClip(clipName, resourcePath)`

Expected audio files (from unityspec.md):
- **SFX**: button_press, robot_slide_out, responses_swoosh, timer_final_10sec, input_accept, player_icon_pop, failure, success
- **VO**: landingrules, question intro, question nudge, time warning, robotanswergone, norobotanswergone

### Profanity Filter

Create `data/banned_words.txt` with one word per line:
```
# Comments start with #
badword1
badword2
etc
```

AnswerValidator will load this file automatically on first use.

### Canvas Setup for Scenes

Each scene should have a Canvas with:
1. **Canvas** component (Screen Space - Camera or Overlay)
2. **CanvasScaler** component
3. **ResponsiveUI** component attached
4. Assign Desktop Content and Mobile Content GameObjects

ResponsiveUI will automatically:
- Detect desktop vs mobile based on screen width
- Configure CanvasScaler reference resolution
- Activate appropriate content

### Button Setup

Any Unity Button can have standard effects:
1. Add **ButtonEffects** component to Button GameObject
2. Effects automatically apply (hover, press, sound)
3. Customizable via Inspector if needed

## Dependencies

### Required Unity Packages
- **TextMeshPro** (for all text elements)
- **DOTween** (for animations) - Install via Package Manager or Asset Store

### Expected Folder Structure
```
Assets/
├── Scripts/              (this codebase)
├── Resources/
│   └── Audio/           (audio clips for runtime loading)
├── Fonts/               (SINK, BILLY, SIGNAL, HAVOKS, HALF AWAKE)
├── Images/              (UI sprites, backgrounds, buttons)
├── Audio/               (audio clips)
└── Video/               (video files)

data/                    (outside Assets, at project root)
├── banned_words.txt
└── questions.json       (to be loaded by future QuestionLoader)
```

---

## Next Steps

**Phase 1: LandingPage Scene** is ready to begin.

Phase 1 will build the entry screen with:
- Background image and fade effects
- Video player integration
- Start game button
- Desktop/mobile layouts
- Scene transitions

See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for Phase 1 details.

## Testing Checklist

Before proceeding to Phase 1, verify:

- [ ] All scripts compile without errors
- [ ] DOTween is installed and imported
- [ ] TextMeshPro is imported
- [ ] Folder structure created correctly
