## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Network Event Flow

```
CLIENT → NetworkManager → WebSocket → SERVER
                ↓
         UnityEvent Fired
                ↓
         GameManager Handler
                ↓
         Update Game State
                ↓
         Notify Screen Controllers
```

### Complete Data Flow

#### Answer Submission:
```
QuestionScreen.SubmitAnswer()
    ↓
NetworkManager.SubmitAnswer(answer)
    ↓
Server processes + broadcasts
    ↓
NetworkManager.OnPlayerAnswered event
    ↓
GameManager.HandlePlayerAnswered()
    ↓
QuestionScreen shows player icon
    ↓
Server: NetworkManager.OnAllAnswersSubmitted
    ↓
GameManager.HandleAllAnswersSubmitted()
    ↓
Transition to EliminationScreen
```

#### Elimination Voting:
```
EliminationScreen.SubmitVote()
    ↓
GameManager.RecordEliminationVote(player, answer)
NetworkManager.SubmitEliminationVote(answer)
    ↓
Server aggregates all votes
    ↓
NetworkManager.OnEliminationComplete event
    ↓
GameManager.HandleEliminationComplete()
    → Populates eliminationResults
    → Adds eliminated answer to Question
    ↓
EliminationScreen.HandleEliminationComplete()
    → Shows result (Robot Identified / Tie)
    ↓
Transition to VotingScreen
```

#### Final Voting:
```
VotingScreen.SubmitVote()
    ↓
GameManager.RecordFinalVote(player, answer)
NetworkManager.SubmitFinalVote(answer)
    ↓
Server aggregates all votes
    ↓
NetworkManager.OnAllVotesSubmitted event
    ↓
GameManager.HandleAllVotesSubmitted()
    → Populates votingResults
    → Host: CalculateRoundScores() ✅
    ↓
VotingScreen.HandleAllVotesSubmitted()
    → Shows correct answer highlight
    ↓
Transition to ResultsScreen
```

#### Results Display:
```
ResultsScreen.Start()
    ↓
If Multiplayer:
    Subscribe to OnFinalRoundScores
    Wait max 10 seconds (timeout fallback)
    ↓
NetworkManager.OnFinalRoundScores event
    ↓
ResultsScreen.HandleFinalRoundScores()
    → StartPanelSequence()
    → Show 4 panels sequentially
    ↓
Next Round or Final Results
```

### Vote Tracking System

```csharp
// GameManager tracks individual votes
Dictionary<string, string> playerEliminationVotes
Dictionary<string, string> playerFinalVotes

// Methods
RecordEliminationVote(playerName, answer)
RecordFinalVote(playerName, answer)
GetPlayerEliminationVote(playerName) → answer
GetPlayerFinalVote(playerName) → answer

// Converts to VoteResults for scoring
HandleEliminationComplete():
    eliminationResults = new VoteResults()
    foreach (kvp in playerEliminationVotes)
        eliminationResults.AddVote(kvp.Value)
    eliminationResults.CalculateElimination()

HandleAllVotesSubmitted():
    votingResults = new VoteResults()
    foreach (kvp in playerFinalVotes)
        votingResults.AddVote(kvp.Value)
    votingResults.CalculateElimination()

    // CRITICAL: Calculate scores (Host only)
    if (IsHost)
        CalculateRoundScores(eliminationResults, votingResults)
```

### Scoring Calculation

```csharp
CalculateRoundScores(eliminationVotes, votingVotes):
    // Null validation ✅
    if (eliminationVotes == null || votingVotes == null)
        return with error

    foreach (roundScore in currentRoundScores):
        // Correct answer points
        if (playerAnswer == correctAnswer)
            roundScore.SetCorrectAnswer(points)

        // Robot identified points
        if (playerEliminationVote == robotAnswer)
            roundScore.SetRobotIdentified(points)

        // Votes received points
        votes = votingVotes.GetVoteCount(playerAnswer)
        roundScore.AddVoteReceived(points per vote)

        // Fooled penalty
        if (playerFinalVote == robotAnswer)
            roundScore.SetFooled(penalty)

        player.AddScore(roundScore.Total)
```

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Duplicate OnDestroy Merged
**File:** QuestionScreenController.cs:124-148
**Issue:** Two OnDestroy methods existed
**Fix:** Merged into single method with all cleanup:
- Network event unsubscription
- Mobile input event unsubscription
- Timer event unsubscription
- DOTween cleanup

### Fix #2: VoteResults Population
**File:** GameManager.cs:456-461, 485-490
**Issue:** VoteResults created but not populated from dictionaries
**Fix:** Added explicit `this.` prefix and dictionary iteration:
```csharp
this.eliminationResults = new VoteResults();
foreach (var kvp in playerEliminationVotes)
    this.eliminationResults.AddVote(kvp.Value);
```

### Fix #3: CalculateRoundScores Integration
**File:** GameManager.cs:500-503
**Issue:** Scores never calculated in multiplayer
**Fix:** Added call in HandleAllVotesSubmitted:
```csharp
if (IsHost)
    CalculateRoundScores(this.eliminationResults, this.votingResults);
```

### Fix #4: ShowCorrectAnswer Compilation Error
**File:** VotingScreenController.cs:285
**Issue:** Method didn't exist
**Fix:** Changed to `ShowResults()`

### Fix #5: Null Check in CalculateRoundScores
**File:** GameManager.cs:315-319
**Issue:** No validation of vote parameters
**Fix:** Added early return with validation:
```csharp
if (eliminationVotes == null || votingVotes == null)
{
    Debug.LogError("Cannot calculate scores: Vote results are null");
    return;
}
```

### Fix #6: Timeout Fallback
**File:** ResultsScreenController.cs:84-92
**Issue:** Could deadlock waiting for server
**Fix:** Added 10-second timeout:
```csharp
DOVirtual.DelayedCall(10f, () =>
{
    if (currentPanel == 0)
    {
        CalculateLocalScores();
        StartPanelSequence();
    }
});
```

### Fix #7: MultiplayerSync Null Safety
**File:** MultiplayerSync.cs (6 locations)
**Issue:** GameManager.Instance accessed without null checks
**Fix:** Added checks to all methods:
```csharp
if (GameManager.Instance == null) return;
```

### Fix #8-11: Screen Integration
**Files:** Elimination/Voting/ResultsScreenController.cs
**Issue:** Missing network event subscriptions
**Fix:** Added complete integration pattern:
- SubscribeToNetworkEvents()
- UnsubscribeFromNetworkEvents()
- Event handlers
- OnDestroy cleanup

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Testing)

1. **Add WebSocket Library**
   ```bash
   # Add to Packages/manifest.json:
   "com.endel.nativewebsocket": "https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket.git#upm"
   ```

2. **Update NetworkManager.cs**
   Replace placeholder WebSocketConnection (lines 496-525) with:
   ```csharp
   using NativeWebSocket;

   private WebSocket webSocket;

   public async void Connect(string url)
   {
       webSocket = new WebSocket(url);

       webSocket.OnOpen += () => {
           isConnected = true;
           OnConnected?.Invoke();
       };

       webSocket.OnMessage += (bytes) => {
           string message = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes);
           HandleMessage(message);
       };

       await webSocket.Connect();
   }
   ```

3. **Build Game Server**
   Create endpoints for:
   - Room creation/joining
   - Answer submission
   - Vote aggregation
   - Score calculation
   - State broadcasting

### Phase 2 (Production Ready)

4. **Add Lobby Screen**
   - Room code display
   - Player list
   - Ready/Start buttons

5. **Implement Session Management**
   - Store local player info
   - Replace hardcoded `Players[0]`

6. **Add Error Handling**
   - Connection lost recovery
   - Reconnection logic
   - Vote timeout handling

7. **Testing**
   - 2-player local test
   - 8-player stress test
   - Disconnect scenarios
   - Score calculation verification

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Dictionary Serialization**
   - `playerEliminationVotes` and `playerFinalVotes` won't show in Inspector
   - Works fine at runtime, just not debuggable visually
   - Could convert to dual-list approach like VoteResults

2. **Hardcoded Player Selection**
   - All screens use `GameManager.Instance.Players[0]`
   - Works for single-player and testing
   - Needs session management for real multiplayer

3. **Eliminated Answer Filtering**
   - VotingScreen doesn't filter eliminated answers yet
   - Line 78: Uses all answers instead of calling `GetNonEliminatedAnswers()`
   - Works if only one elimination per round

### Design Decisions

1. **Host Calculates Scores**
   - Only host calls `CalculateRoundScores()`
   - Reduces server load
   - Assumes host is trusted

2. **Client Trusts Server**
   - Clients use server-provided data
   - No client-side validation
   - Appropriate for cooperative game

3. **Timeout Fallback**
   - 10-second timeout before local calculation
   - Prevents indefinite waiting
   - May cause desync if server is just slow
